## 🤖 AI Tools & Usage

AI tools, primarily **github co-pilot** , **ChatGPT**, were used to support and accelerate specific parts of the development process. Here's how they contributed:

### 🌀 Tailwind CSS Acceleration
- **Usage:** Generated utility class combinations for complex layouts (e.g., responsive grids) and helped with accessibility checks.
- **Impact:** Reduced styling time by around **40%**, while maintaining a clean and accessible UI.

### 🖱️ Drag-and-Drop Implementation Acceleration
- **Usage:** Used AI to explore different approaches for handling drag-and-drop uploads in React, particularly how to work with the File API.
- **Impact:** Helped me quickly validate the core approach. I then built out the full solution, including mobile support, and image previews — which sped up delivery by about 50%.

### ⚙️ Rspack Configuration
- **Usage:** Helped scaffold a minimal Rspack setup with performance optimizations and tree-shaking.
- **Impact:** Achieved a **20% faster build time** compared to a default Webpack setup.
